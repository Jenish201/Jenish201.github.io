## Unlocking the Power of User Reviews for Personalized Recommendations
In this project, I developed a Yelp recommendation system that harnesses the power of user reviews to provide personalized suggestions for businesses. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, I created a robust model that analyzes user preferences and recommends relevant businesses.

## Key Features:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Processed a large dataset of Yelp reviews to extract meaningful features and reduce dimensionality
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Implemented sentiment analysis to capture user opinions and emotions, enabling the model to understand user preferences.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Employed collaborative filtering to identify patterns in user behavior and generate personalized recommendations.
- **Model Evaluation**: Conducted thorough model evaluation using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure the model's accuracy and reliabilty.

## What You'll Find in the Repository:
- A comprehensive report detailing the project's methodology, results, and insights (DSC672_FinalReport.pdf)
- Python code implementing the recommendation system, including data preprocessing, feature extraction and model training.
- A dataset of Yelp reviews used for model training and testing

## Why This Project Matters:
This project demonstates my ability to:
- Collect, preprocess and analyze large datasYelp recommendation system.
- Apply NLP and machine learning techniques to real-world problems
- Develop and evaluate recommendataion systems
- Communicate complex technical concepts through clear and concise reporting
