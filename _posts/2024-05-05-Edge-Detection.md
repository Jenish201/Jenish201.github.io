## Project Description

This project demonstrates real-time edge detection using a webcam feed. By leveraging OpenCV's Canny Edge Detection algorithm, it identifies edges within each frame and displays the results instantaneously. The project is implemented in Python and serves as an excellent example of applying edge detection to live video.

## Features
- **Real-Time Edge Detection**: Processes each frame captured from the webcam and identifies edges using the Canny algorithm.
- **OpenCV**: Utilizes OpenCV's Canny function for robust edge detection.


## Libraries Used
- OpenCV

## Applications
- **Robotics**: Use edge detection for object detection and tracking in robots.
- **Computer Vision Research**: Apply edge detection to images and video feeds for research purposes. 
- **Art and Design**: Create artistic effects by highlighting edges.
