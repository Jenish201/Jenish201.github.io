## Project Description

This project uses OpenCV and Haar cascades to detect faces and eyes in real time through a webcam. It employs machine learning models trained on facial features to identify these elements efficiently. The project is implemented in Python and can be used as a quick prototype or proof-of-concept for real-time face and eye detection applications.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Leverages live webcam feed to detect faces and eyes instantaneously.
- **OpenCV**: Uses OpenCV's `CascadeClassifier` for face and eye detection.
- **Haar Cascade Models**: Employs pre-trained Haar cascade models for detecting frontal faces and eyes.

## Libraries Used
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Applications
- **Security**: Integrate real-time detection for security cameras.
- **Biometric Authentication**: Detect and recognize individuals for secure login.
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Build applicaitons responding to facial gestures.
