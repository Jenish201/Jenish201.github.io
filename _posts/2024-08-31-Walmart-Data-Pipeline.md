## Unlocking Insights from Sales Data for Informed Decision-Making

In this project, I developed a data pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads sales data from Walmart's grocery sales and complementary datasets. By leveraging data engineering techniques and tools such as pandas, NumPy, and PostgreSQL, I created a robust pipeline that provides actionable insights into sales trends and patterns.


## Key Features:
- **Data Extraction**: Extracted sales data from PostgreSQL and Parquet files, handling missing values and data type conversions.

- **Data Transformation**: Implemented data transformation workflows to calculate average weekly sales per month and filter out irrelevant data.

- **Data Loading**: Engineered ELT pipelines to load transformed data into CSV files, ensuring seamless data sharing and collaboration.

- **Data Validation**: Conducted thorough data validation checks to ensure data quality and consistency across datasets.


## What You'll Find in the Repository:
- Python code implementing the data pipeline, including data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- A dataset of Walmart sales data used for pipeline development and testing.
- A comprehensive report detailing the project's methodology, results and insights.

## Why This Project Matters:
This project demonstrates my ability to:
-  Design and implement data pipelines for large datasets.
- Apply data engineering techniques to real-world problems.
- Develop and evaluate data transformation workflows.
- Communicate complex technical concepts through clear and concise reporting.
